# How-To-Read-Sensor-Data-Using-Python-and-Arduino
Hello everyone!! In this repository I will show a simplest way you can read data from sensors using Arduino with Python Language. In this project i used two sensors (ultrassonic and Temperature) to read data from them.

There are three (3) examples in  this repository. The first one is to turn on and off an LED by giving a specific command. Th code work the same way in Arduino and Python as well. The Second one is to read data any sensor (DHT, ultrasoonic, Infrared, etc.) using serial communication to interface python and Arduino.
